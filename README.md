What in the world is Regex?! Well, let me tell you what I have learned about it.  



## Summary

Regex is a short for regular express, which uses a series of characters to recognize patterns in user input. The most common occurance of using regex is when signing up for a service or filling out a form to verify that you are entering your information correctly. For example, when entering your email address, at the bottom it may say something along the lines of please enter a your email (i.e. youremail@email.com). If what the user entered doesn't follow this pattern then it will give you an error. 

```bash
const regexEmail = ^([a-zA-z0-9_\-\.]+)@([a-zA-z0-9_\-\.]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,5})$;
```

There's a lot going on there, lets break it down!
